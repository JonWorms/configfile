# configfile

this repo contains a basic class that can read and write to a line delimited configuration file
At the moment it's rather rudementary, but it's simple and is getting the job done for me.

It is able to preserve any comments in the file, including ones that may be trailing a value assignment

This is the first time I've messed around with testing via CMake so, if you run the test more than once, you need to run cmake each time
